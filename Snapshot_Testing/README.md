# These scripts are used to create and cleanup snapshots using the APIs on Prism Element

Copy the scripts and config into the same directory.  Powershell 5 or better is required.

The default action for the Cleanup script is to delete the snapshot.  This is so you can hit [ENTER] over and over to do mass cleanup.  It does print the snapshot details for a visual check as a saftey measure.
